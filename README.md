# OENG1090 Post Earthquake Micro Autonomous Rubble Pile Explorer Rescue Robot

Descrpition: This is the master's research thesis specificially designed at RMIT University, Melbourne Australia during July to October 20203. It focused on using machine learning onto ROS and Gazebo to simulate indoor post-earthquake environments. 

Project Details:
1) Dataset: This is to ensure to protect the privacy of the user (me) as well as further developing this project as freely as possible.
2) Gazebo Files: With conjunction with 3D models by Nguyen et al (https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Faioz-ai%2FIROS20_NMFNet&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw19BJuCfsK83J5Bunjm1KTY), the only folder and file is the world file made of these models.
